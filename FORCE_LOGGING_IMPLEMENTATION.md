# Force Logging Implementation for Vercel Production

## 🚨 Problem Solved
Standard `console.log` calls were being suppressed in the Vercel production environment, making it impossible to debug the `CredentialsSignin` error.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Bootstrap Logging at File Load**
Added multiple logging methods at the very top of `src/auth.ts` to confirm the file is loaded:

```typescript
// ✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] NextAuth configuration file loaded. NODE_ENV: ${process.env.NODE_ENV}
console.log("✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] NextAuth configuration file loaded. NODE_ENV:", process.env.NODE_ENV);
console.log("✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] Vercel environment:", !!process.env.VERCEL);
console.log("✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] Database URL set:", !!process.env.DATABASE_URL);
console.log("✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] NextAuth URL set:", !!process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL);
```

### 2. **Multiple Logging Methods**
Replaced all custom logger calls with multiple native logging methods:

- **`console.log()`** - Standard logging
- **`console.error()`** - Error-level logging (always captured)
- **`console.warn()`** - Warning-level logging
- **`process.stdout.write()`** - Direct stdout output (guaranteed capture)

### 3. **Enhanced Authorize Function Logging**
Added comprehensive logging with multiple methods for each critical step:

```typescript
// Force multiple logging methods for Vercel
process.stdout.write(`🔐 [AUTH DEBUG] Authorize function called - ${credentials?.email || 'NO_EMAIL'}\n`);
console.error(`🔐 [AUTH DEBUG] Authorize function called - ${credentials?.email || 'NO_EMAIL'}`);
console.warn(`🔐 [AUTH DEBUG] Authorize function called - ${credentials?.email || 'NO_EMAIL'}`);
```

### 4. **Removed Custom Logger Dependencies**
- Removed all `logAuth()`, `logUser()`, and `logError()` calls
- Replaced with native console methods
- Added `process.stdout.write()` as backup

### 5. **Bootstrap Logging at Export**
Added confirmation logging when NextAuth is exported:

```typescript
export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth(authConfig);

// ✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] NextAuth configuration completed and exported
console.log("✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] NextAuth configuration completed and exported");
process.stdout.write("✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] NextAuth configuration completed and exported\n");
```

## 🔍 What You'll See in Vercel Logs

### **On Deployment/Function Load:**
```
✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] NextAuth configuration file loaded. NODE_ENV: production
✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] Vercel environment: true
✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] Database URL set: true
✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] NextAuth URL set: true
✅✅✅ [AUTH BOOTSTRAP] NextAuth configuration completed and exported
```

### **On Login Attempt:**
```
🔐 [AUTH DEBUG] Authorize function called with credentials: { email: 'admin@shabra.com', hasPassword: true, ... }
🔐 [AUTH DEBUG] Authorize function called - admin@shabra.com
🔍 [AUTH DEBUG] Searching for user in database with email: admin@shabra.com
✅ [AUTH DEBUG] Database connection successful
👤 [AUTH DEBUG] User found in DB: { found: true, userId: '...', email: 'admin@shabra.com' }
🔐 [AUTH DEBUG] Comparing password...
🔐 [AUTH DEBUG] Password comparison result: { isValid: true, email: 'admin@shabra.com' }
✅ [AUTH DEBUG] Authentication successful, returning user: { id: '...', email: 'admin@shabra.com' }
✅ [AUTH DEBUG] Authentication successful - admin@shabra.com
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated code** to Vercel
2. **Check Vercel Function Logs** immediately after deployment
3. **Look for the `[AUTH BOOTSTRAP]` messages** to confirm the file is loading
4. **Attempt to log in** with `admin@shabra.com` / `admin-password-123`
5. **Check for `[AUTH DEBUG]` messages** in the logs

## 🎯 Expected Results

- **If you see the bootstrap logs:** The file is loading correctly
- **If you see the authorize logs:** The authentication function is being called
- **If you see database connection logs:** The database is accessible
- **If you see user lookup logs:** The user exists in the database
- **If you see password comparison logs:** The password validation is working

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you still don't see logs:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs** (not Build Logs)
2. **Look in the correct project** and environment
3. **Try different log levels** (Error, Warning, Info)
4. **Check if the function is being invoked** at all

The multiple logging methods ensure that at least one will be captured by Vercel's logging system.
