# Architectural Decision Log (ADR)

## üéØ **Purpose**

This document records the reasoning behind significant technical choices made during the Shabra OS project development. Each decision is documented with its context, the decision made, and the consequences of that choice.

**Why ADRs?** Architectural decisions have long-term consequences. Documenting them ensures:

- Future developers understand why certain choices were made
- Changes can be evaluated against original reasoning
- Knowledge is preserved across development sessions
- Technical debt decisions are traceable

## üìã **Template for New Entries**

### **Decision [Number]: [Title]**

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Status:** [PROPOSED | ACCEPTED | DEPRECATED | SUPERSEDED]  
**Deciders:** [List of people involved in the decision]  
**Technical Story:** [Link to related issue or story]

#### **Context**

[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.]

#### **Decision**

[Describe our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will ..."]

#### **Consequences**

[Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.]

#### **Alternatives Considered**

[Describe the alternatives that were considered, and why they were not chosen. This section is optional but recommended for complex decisions.]

#### **Implementation Notes**

[Any additional notes about how this decision was or will be implemented. This section is optional.]

### **Decision 001: Adoption of a Documentation-First Protocol**

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Deciders:** AI Development Team  
**Technical Story:** Documentation Hub Implementation

#### **Context**

The initial development process for Shabra OS lacked formal documentation standards. The AI's chat context was reaching its limit, making it increasingly difficult to maintain continuity across development sessions. Critical project knowledge, architectural decisions, and implementation details were at risk of being lost. The project needed a reliable, persistent source of truth that could survive context limitations and serve as a foundation for future development.

#### **Decision**

We will pause active development and create a comprehensive, in-repository documentation hub (`/docs`) to serve as the single source of truth for the project. This establishes a new mandatory protocol: **Documentation-First**. All future development work must be documented before, during, and after implementation. The documentation hub will contain:

- Project overview and current status
- Strategic roadmap and critical priorities
- Architecture and system design documents
- Progress tracking and completed work logs
- Performance metrics and optimization records
- Protocol standards and contributing guidelines

#### **Consequences**

**Positive:**

- All future development will be more robust and context-independent
- New contributors (AI or human) can join the project with minimal onboarding
- Project history and technical decisions are permanently preserved
- Development continuity is maintained across sessions and team changes
- Professional engineering standards are established and enforced
- Knowledge transfer becomes systematic and reliable

**Neutral:**

- Development velocity may temporarily decrease due to documentation overhead
- All team members must adapt to the new documentation-first workflow

**Negative:**

- Initial time investment required to establish the documentation foundation
- Risk of documentation becoming outdated if not actively maintained

#### **Alternatives Considered**

1. **Continue without documentation:** Rejected due to high risk of knowledge loss and context limitations
2. **Minimal documentation:** Rejected as insufficient for long-term project sustainability
3. **External documentation tools:** Rejected due to dependency on external services and potential access issues
4. **Chat-based knowledge management:** Rejected due to context limitations and lack of persistence

#### **Implementation Notes**

- Documentation hub created at `/docs` with comprehensive structure
- All existing project knowledge retroactively documented
- New protocol enforced through mandatory documentation-first workflow
- Regular documentation quality checks established
- Cross-referencing system implemented for easy navigation

## üîÑ **Decision Lifecycle**

### **Status Definitions**

- **PROPOSED:** Decision is under consideration
- **ACCEPTED:** Decision has been made and is being implemented
- **DEPRECATED:** Decision has been superseded by newer decisions
- **SUPERSEDED:** Decision has been replaced by a newer decision

### **Review Process**

- All ADRs should be reviewed quarterly
- Deprecated decisions should be marked and archived
- New decisions should reference related previous decisions
- Implementation status should be updated regularly
