# Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Description

You are experiencing login problems with redirect loops or errors preventing access to the dashboard.

## What I've Fixed

### 1. **Middleware Security & Functionality** ✅

- **BEFORE**: Middleware only checked for token existence (security vulnerability)
- **AFTER**: Middleware now properly validates sessions using NextAuth's `auth()` function
- **BEFORE**: Potential redirect loops due to improper session validation
- **AFTER**: Proper session validation prevents redirect loops

### 2. **Authentication Configuration** ✅

- **BEFORE**: Console logging in production (security risk)
- **AFTER**: Proper logging levels based on environment
- **BEFORE**: Debug mode always enabled (performance issue)
- **AFTER**: Debug mode only in development
- **BEFORE**: Missing session maxAge configuration
- **AFTER**: 24-hour session timeout configured

### 3. **Login Page Improvements** ✅

- **BEFORE**: No session status checking
- **AFTER**: Proper session status handling with loading states
- **BEFORE**: Potential race conditions in authentication flow
- **AFTER**: Proper useEffect hooks for session management
- **BEFORE**: Console logging in production
- **AFTER**: Clean error handling without console logs

### 4. **Type Safety** ✅

- **BEFORE**: Missing NextAuth type declarations
- **AFTER**: Proper TypeScript types for sessions and JWT tokens

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Clear Browser Data

1. Clear all cookies and local storage for your domain
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart your browser

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-here-minimum-32-characters"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
PRISMA_DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
```

### Step 3: Test Authentication Flow

1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Check the AuthDebugger component (bottom-right corner in development)
4. Verify you're redirected to the dashboard

### Step 4: Test Protected Routes

1. Try accessing `/projects` or `/storyboard` directly
2. You should be redirected to login if not authenticated
3. After login, you should be redirected back to the intended page

## Debugging Tools Added

### AuthDebugger Component

- Shows current authentication status
- Displays user information when logged in
- Only visible in development mode
- Helps troubleshoot authentication issues

### Enhanced Logging

- Proper log levels based on environment
- No sensitive data in logs
- Structured error logging

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still getting redirect loops

**Solution**: Check that your database is running and accessible. Verify that users exist in the database.

### Issue: Login form not submitting

**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors. Verify that the form is properly connected to the submit handler.

### Issue: Session not persisting

**Solution**: Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set and is at least 32 characters long. Check that cookies are enabled in your browser.

### Issue: Database connection errors

**Solution**: Verify your database is running and the connection string is correct. Check that Prisma migrations have been applied.

## Security Improvements Made

1. **Proper Session Validation**: Middleware now validates actual session data, not just token existence
2. **Removed Console Logging**: No sensitive information logged in production
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Authentication errors are handled securely
4. **Session Timeout**: 24-hour session expiration for security
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types prevent runtime errors

## Next Steps

1. **Test the authentication flow** with the steps above
2. **Remove the AuthDebugger** once authentication is working (remove from layout.tsx)
3. **Monitor for any remaining issues** and check the browser console
4. **Verify database connectivity** if authentication still fails

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the browser's Network tab for failed requests
2. Verify the database has users with proper password hashes
3. Check that NextAuth cookies are being set properly
4. Ensure your database schema matches the Prisma schema
5. Verify that bcrypt is working properly for password comparison

## Files Modified

- `src/middleware.ts` - Complete rewrite for security and functionality
- `src/auth.ts` - Removed console logs, improved error handling
- `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Enhanced session handling
- `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` - Added proper type declarations
- `src/components/debug/AuthDebugger.tsx` - New debugging component
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Temporarily added debugger

The authentication system should now work properly with proper security measures in place.
