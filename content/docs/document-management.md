  name         String
  url          String

  fileType     String
  category     DocumentCategory
  uploadedById String
  createdAt    DateTime         @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime         @updatedAt

  user         User             @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  uploadedBy   User             @relation("DocumentUploader", fields: [uploadedById], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

## Best Practices

### File Naming
- Use descriptive names that clearly identify the document
- Include dates when relevant (e.g., "Employment Contract 2024")
- Avoid special characters and spaces

### Category Selection
- Choose the most appropriate category for easy organization
- Use "OTHER" only when no other category fits
- Be consistent with categorization across the organization

### Security
- Regularly review document access permissions
- Monitor upload activity for suspicious patterns
- Keep Cloudinary credentials secure and rotate them periodically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Upload Fails**
   - Check file size (must be under 10MB)
   - Verify file type is supported
   - Ensure Cloudinary credentials are correct

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Verify user has appropriate role (Admin/Manager)
   - Check manager-subordinate relationship for managers
   - Ensure user is authenticated

3. **File Not Found**
   - Check if document was deleted
   - Verify user has access to the document
   - Check Cloudinary storage status
