# UI Update Fix - Storyboard Template Assignment

## Problem Identified

When assigning a template to an empty slot, the backend mutation was successful (stories were created/updated in the database), but the frontend UI was not updating to reflect the changes. The slot continued to show the "Empty Slot" state until a manual page refresh was performed.

## Root Cause

The issue was with **React Query cache invalidation**. After successful mutations (create/update/delete stories), the frontend cache was not being properly invalidated and refetched, causing the UI to display stale data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cache Invalidation Strategy

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/storyboard/StoryManagementNew.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useStoryboardOperationsNew.ts`
- `src/hooks/useStoryboardData.ts`

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Aggressive Cache Invalidation

```typescript
onSuccess: async () => {
  // Invalidate specific query
  await queryClient.invalidateQueries({
    queryKey: storiesKeys.byDay(dateString),
  });

  // Invalidate all stories queries for consistency
  await queryClient.invalidateQueries({
    queryKey: storiesKeys.all,
  });

  // Force refetch the specific query
  await queryClient.refetchQueries({
    queryKey: storiesKeys.byDay(dateString),
  });
};
```

#### B. Added Debug Logging

Added comprehensive console logging to track:

- Date string formatting
- Query key generation
- Cache invalidation process
- Mutation success/failure

#### C. Consistent Date Formatting

Ensured that the same date formatting (`date-fns-jalali` with `yyyy-MM-dd`) is used consistently across:

- Data fetching hook (`useStoryboardData`)
- Cache invalidation in mutations
- API calls

### 2. Mutation Success Handlers Updated

**All three mutations now have enhanced success handlers:**

- `createStoryMutation` - For creating new stories
- `updateStoryMutation` - For updating existing stories
- `deleteStoryMutation` - For deleting stories

**Each handler now:**

1. Shows success message
2. Invalidates cache for current date
3. Invalidates all stories cache
4. Forces refetch of current date stories
5. Clears selected slot state
6. Logs the process for debugging

### 3. Operations Hook Enhancement

**File:** `src/hooks/useStoryboardOperationsNew.ts`

**Enhanced `applyTemplate` function:**

- Added explicit cache invalidation after template application
- Added refetch to ensure immediate UI update
- Maintained error handling and user feedback

## Technical Details

### Query Key Structure

```typescript
storiesKeys.byDay(dateString); // ['stories', 'day', '1404-06-12']
```

### Cache Invalidation Strategy

1. **Invalidate specific query** - Marks the current date's stories as stale
2. **Invalidate all stories** - Ensures consistency across the app
3. **Force refetch** - Immediately fetches fresh data from server

### Date Format Consistency

- **Jalali Calendar**: Using `date-fns-jalali` for Persian date formatting
- **Format**: `yyyy-MM-dd` (e.g., `1404-06-12`)
- **Consistency**: Same format used in query keys, API calls, and cache invalidation

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### âœ… Template Assignment

1. User clicks on empty slot â†’ Slot becomes selected
2. User clicks on template â†’ Template is assigned to slot
3. **UI immediately updates** to show the assigned template
4. Success message appears
5. Slot selection is cleared

### âœ… Data Persistence

1. Changes are saved to database
2. UI reflects the changes immediately
3. Hard refresh shows the same state
4. No manual refresh required

### âœ… Error Handling

1. Clear error messages for failed operations
2. UI state remains consistent
3. Cache is not corrupted on errors

## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to Storyboard page**
2. **Select a date** using the date picker
3. **Click on an empty slot** (should show selection)
4. **Click on a template** from the palette
5. **Verify immediate UI update** - slot should show the template immediately
6. **Check browser console** for debug logs showing cache invalidation
7. **Perform hard refresh** to verify persistence
8. **Test deletion** - should also update UI immediately

## Debug Information

The fix includes comprehensive logging that will show in the browser console:

- `ðŸ“… useStoryboardData` - Date and query key information
- `ðŸ”„ Invalidating cache` - Cache invalidation process
- `âœ… Cache invalidation completed` - Success confirmation

This logging helps identify any remaining issues with date formatting or query key mismatches.

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/storyboard/StoryManagementNew.tsx` - Enhanced mutation success handlers
2. `src/hooks/useStoryboardOperationsNew.ts` - Enhanced template application
3. `src/hooks/useStoryboardData.ts` - Added debug logging

## Result

The UI should now update immediately upon successful template assignment, deletion, or any other story operations, without requiring manual page refresh. The cache invalidation strategy ensures that the frontend always displays the most current data from the database.
