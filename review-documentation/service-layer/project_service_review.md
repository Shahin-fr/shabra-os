### Security & Bug Analysis

- **Missing authorization and tenant scoping**
  - Lines: 19-56, 61-79, 118-178, 183-209, 214-278, 283-299, 303-324
  - The service does not verify caller authorization or scope queries by owner/team/organization. Methods read and mutate any project by `id` without checking `accessLevel` or user membership. If the app is multi-tenant, this allows cross-tenant data access and unauthorized mutations. Enforce authorization via user context (e.g., `actor.userId`, `actor.orgId`) and add `where` clauses to scope Prisma queries, e.g., `where: { id: projectId, orgId: actor.orgId }`. Respect `accessLevel` for read paths.

- **Unstructured errors with ambiguous semantics**
  - Lines: 74-76, 127-129, 189-191, 237-239
  - Throws plain `Error('Project not found')`. Conventions require returning structured errors at boundaries and preserving correct semantics (e.g., 404). For service-level, define domain errors (e.g., `NotFoundError`, `ForbiddenError`, `ConflictError`) to enable route handlers to map to proper HTTP responses and avoid leaking internal messages.

- **Untyped input in createProject**
  - Lines: 84-87
  - `data: any` bypasses type safety. Use a typed DTO derived from zod: `type CreateProjectData = z.infer<typeof CreateProjectSchema>` and accept that type to ensure compile-time guarantees.

- **Weak validation for status-only paths**
  - Lines: 283-296
  - `status: string` is cast to a union but never validated. Invalid values will reach the DB and error at runtime. Validate with zod or a `Prisma.ProjectStatus` enum type.

- **Pagination parameters not bounded**
  - Lines: 24-27
  - `page`/`limit` parsed without clamping or maximum limits. A large `limit` could stress the DB and API. Clamp `limit` to a safe ceiling (e.g., 100) and `page >= 1`.

- **Logging sensitive payloads**
  - Lines: 88-92, 131-135
  - Logs include full validated payloads. While helpful for debugging, this may include sensitive content (e.g., project descriptions). Prefer logging minimal, non-sensitive fields and record IDs; mask free-text fields.

- **Delete semantics and referential integrity**
  - Lines: 198-201
  - `delete` has no guard for related entities (e.g., stories, tasks). Depending on schema, this may throw or cascade unexpectedly. Decide on policy (cascade or restrict) and surface a meaningful domain error if deletion is blocked.

- **Date parsing edge cases**
  - Lines: 100-101, 158-164
  - `new Date(string)` can produce `Invalid Date` if the validator allows ambiguous formats. Ensure `CreateProjectSchema`/`UpdateProjectSchema` normalizes to ISO strings or dates, or add runtime checks before persisting.

- **Idempotency for create**
  - Lines: 93-105
  - No idempotency handling. If clients retry, duplicates may be created. Support an idempotency key at the API boundary and enforce via unique constraint or a token table.

### Performance & Scalability Review

- **Unbounded list queries**
  - Lines: 24-27, 29-44
  - Lack of `limit` ceiling can lead to large result sets. Clamp `limit` and consider index coverage for `orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }`.

- **Count and list consistency**
  - Lines: 29-44, 46-55
  - `project.count()` is computed independently of `findMany` filters. If filters are added (or already applied upstream), totals may not match the page. Use identical `where` across both calls to avoid discrepancies.

- **N+1 avoided with include counts â€” good, but verify indexes**
  - Lines: 30-43, 284-295, 304-321
  - `_count` usage is efficient. Ensure indexes exist on foreign keys for `stories` and `tasks` to keep counts fast, and on `createdAt` for ordering.

- **Stats computation loads all child rows**
  - Lines: 214-233, 241-257
  - Fetches all `stories`/`tasks` statuses and reduces in memory. For large projects, this is heavy. Prefer DB-side aggregation: `groupBy({ by: ['status'], _count: { _all: true } })` to minimize transferred data.

- **Search by `contains` may not scale**
  - Lines: 303-321
  - `contains` with `mode: 'insensitive'` usually translates to `ILIKE %term%` which is not index-friendly. Consider trigram/GIN indices, full-text search, or a search service. Also clamp `limit` and validate `searchTerm` length to mitigate expensive scans.

- **Transactions for single-row write**
  - Lines: 93-105
  - Wrapping a single `create` in a transaction adds overhead without benefit. Unless you plan multi-step operations, perform a direct `create`.

### Architectural & Clean Code Assessment

- **Service return shapes vs. conventions**
  - Lines: 46-55, 78-79, 112-113, 176-178, 208-209, 259-277, 297-298, 323-324
  - Returns raw Prisma entities or custom objects; errors are thrown. Conventions prefer structured results at boundaries. Consider a service pattern returning typed results (e.g., `Result<T, E>`) and let route handlers map to the standardized API envelope.

- **Types and enums**
  - Lines: 99-103, 141-156, 285, 303
  - Multiple manual casts to string unions. Prefer Prisma-generated enums (e.g., `Prisma.ProjectStatus`) or TS enums, and derive DTO types from zod schemas to eliminate `any` and unsafe casts.

- **Input normalization is partially duplicated**
  - Lines: 146-164
  - Manual trimming and nulling repeat schema concerns. Consolidate normalization in zod transforms to keep service logic focused on orchestration.

- **Logging strategy**
  - Lines: 88-92, 131-135, 172-175, 193-206
  - Logging includes operation context (good). Refine to structured, minimal logs; include correlation/request IDs and avoid logging raw free-text fields.

- **Method organization**
  - Entire file
  - Methods are cohesive and named clearly. Consider extracting shared helpers for pagination normalization and `not found` checks to reduce duplication and centralize policy.

### Recommended Remediations (prioritized)

1. Enforce authorization and tenant scoping in all read/write queries; respect `accessLevel`.
2. Introduce domain error classes and structured result handling; map to API error envelope in route handlers.
3. Replace `any` with zod-inferred DTOs; use Prisma enums for statuses.
4. Clamp and validate pagination and search parameters; set safe maximums.
5. Move project statistics to DB-side aggregation with `groupBy`.
6. Add proper indexes (e.g., on `createdAt`, FKs; consider trigram/FTS for name search) or move to a search service.
7. Revisit delete behavior; implement cascade/restrict policy with meaningful errors.
8. Reduce sensitive payload logging; include correlation IDs.
9. Remove unnecessary transaction around single create or expand to atomic multi-step if needed.
