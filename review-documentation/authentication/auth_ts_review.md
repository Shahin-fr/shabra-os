### Security & Bug Analysis

-  **Lines 12-14, 31-34**: Production-only fatal checks for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` run at import time. Impact: These synchronous throws will crash the server on misconfiguration, which is good for security, but can also disrupt environments where `process.env` is injected later or in serverless cold starts. Consider consolidating in NextAuth init or a small bootstrap that runs once and logs a single structured error.

-  **Lines 15-29**: Runtime env validation attempts to skip Vercel builds, checking `typeof window === 'undefined'` and `!process.env.VERCEL`. Impact: Coupling to the `VERCEL` env may miss other platforms and create blind spots where secrets are not validated. Prefer a generic server-runtime check and always validate in true production.

-  **Lines 36-50, 153-206**: Custom cookie names/options are set to secure in production and sameSite=lax. Impact: Generally solid. Ensure `__Host-` prefix rules are respected (must be secure, path=/, no Domain). Here `csrfToken` uses `__Host-` only in name, not guaranteed host-only. Consider `__Host-` only when domain is not set and secure=true in all environments where used.

-  **Lines 58-106**: Credentials provider `authorize` fetches user by email and compares password with bcrypt.
   -  **Lines 66-80**: Selecting `password` and `isActive` is appropriate. Impact: Leaks of timing on `findUnique` could allow enumeration if responses differ; code returns `null` uniformly which is good, but consider adding a small constant-time delay on failure to reduce oracle risk.
   -  **Lines 82-93**: Returns `null` for inactive or invalid password. Impact: Good uniform failure shape; consider logging authentication failure with a redacted context and rate limiting upstream.
   -  **Lines 95-101**: `roles` mapping coerces string to array with fallback `['EMPLOYEE']`. Impact: Risk of privilege escalation defaults if DB lacks roles; better to default to empty array and enforce authorization elsewhere.
   -  **Lines 102-105**: Catch-all returns `null` hides operational errors (e.g., DB outage). Impact: Suppresses alerts and complicates incident response. Prefer logging unexpected errors server-side (with no sensitive data) and surfacing a generic error.

-  **Lines 109-147, 115-124, 126-144**: JWT and session callbacks augment tokens and session.
   -  **Lines 115-124**: Persists `roles`, `avatar`, `email`, `name` onto JWT without schema validation. Impact: If `user` is crafted or provider misconfig returns unexpected shapes, token bloat or unsafe claims can occur. Validate/whitelist fields and constrain types; avoid storing large `avatar` inline if it can be derived.
   -  **Lines 126-135**: Creates default `session.user` with blank strings. Impact: Prevents undefined access but may mask bugs; prefer strict type guarantees over sentinel empty values.
   -  **Lines 141-144**: Uses `(session.user as any)`. Impact: Type unsafety; could mask runtime mistakes. Extend the `Session` type via module augmentation instead.

-  **Lines 36-41**: `trustHost: true` and `useSecureCookies` in production. Impact: `trustHost: true` is recommended in NextAuth v5 when behind proxies, but ensure correct `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set; otherwise, open redirect or cookie domain issues could occur.

-  **General**: No account lockout, MFA, or login throttling present. Impact: Brute-force risk for credentials provider. Implement rate limiting at edge (middleware) and consider MFA for privileged roles.

### Performance & Scalability Review

-  **Lines 66-80**: Single `findUnique` with `select` is efficient. Impact: Good minimal projection; ensure proper index on `email` (usually default). Consider case-insensitive email lookups if your system treats emails case-insensitively.

-  **Lines 86-93**: `bcrypt.compare` is CPU-bound. Impact: High QPS could exhaust CPU on login bursts. Ensure appropriate bcrypt cost factor; consider adaptive throttling or offloading to a worker if needed.

-  **Lines 109-113**: `session.maxAge` 30 days and `updateAge` 24 hours. Impact: Reasonable; longer sessions increase exposure if tokens leak. Evaluate alignment with security posture.

-  **Lines 153-206**: Custom cookie config with maxAge 30 days, PKCE 15 minutes. Impact: Sensible. Ensure headers and caching policies prevent accidental storage by intermediaries.

-  **Lines 115-124, 126-144**: JWT size grows with additional claims (`roles`, `avatar`, `name`). Impact: Larger headers on every request; prefer minimal claims and fetch user profile server-side when necessary.

-  **General**: `initializeProductionFixes()` side effects at import time can add latency on cold start. Impact: If expensive, move to lazy initialization or idempotent `once` pattern.

### Architectural & Clean Code Assessment

-  **Lines 1-2, 212-213**: Header/footer comments are redundant. Impact: Noiseâ€”prefer meaningful docs or JSDoc.

-  **Lines 9-14**: Import side-effect `initializeProductionFixes()` at module top-level. Impact: Harder to test; move into a bootstrap or ensure idempotency and explicit invocation.

-  **Lines 36-50**: Inline `authConfig` object is clear but lacks type annotation. Impact: Add explicit `NextAuthConfig` type for stronger guarantees and editor help.

-  **Lines 58-107**: `authorize` uses broad `any` for `credentials` and `user` propagation. Impact: Type leakage; define a `Credentials` schema (zod) and use its inferred types.

-  **Lines 95-101**: Role normalization mixes data mapping with policy (default role). Impact: Move policy to an authorization layer; keep auth token claims reflective of actual persisted state.

-  **Lines 115-124, 126-144**: Session/JWT callbacks duplicate responsibility for mapping fields. Impact: Extract small pure helpers (e.g., `mapUserToJwt`, `mapTokenToSession`) with unit tests.

-  **Lines 141-144**: `any` casts. Impact: Replace with module augmentation of `next-auth` types to add `roles` and `avatar` explicitly.

-  **Pages config (149-152)**: Redirects errors to `/login`. Impact: Good DX, but consider preserving error codes via query params for UX and auditing.

-  **Testing**: No tests co-located. Impact: Add unit tests for callbacks and integration tests for sign-in flow.

Recommendations (Summary):
- Validate envs in a single, platform-agnostic production gate; keep fatal on missing secrets.
- Log unexpected errors in `authorize` with redaction; add edge rate limiting and optional MFA.
- Remove default role fallback; rely on persisted roles; validate claims.
- Minimize JWT claims; avoid `avatar` in token if possible.
- Replace `any` with proper type augmentation; add zod validation for credentials.
- Consider constant-time failure delays and account lockout after repeated failures.
- Add helper mappers and tests; move side effects out of module top-level.
